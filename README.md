# Mobile-Robot-Localization
Robot localization and obstacle avoidance navigation using MCL and VFH algorithms.

In the field of robotics, one of the most challenging problems is localization especially in a complex environment. This study investigates the Monte Carlo Localization algorithm and demonstrates how it can be used to identify a mobile robot's position in an unknown environment. Robot Operating System (ROS) is used to simulate Monte Carlo Localization algorithm using a TurtleBot in the gazebo platform. In this project, the impact of the number of particles that are used to localize a robot is analysed. This study also summarizes the effect of other secondary factors like the map, environment, and navigation on the localization process.
